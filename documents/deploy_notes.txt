Notes on Deployment of examples

Live Scripts (*.mlx) can be exported as ipynb notebooks for Jupyter, but the 
user has to pip install some code, ensure matlab is on the path and still needs
a licence. This is too complicated for these simple examples.

Development of code, LiveScripts etc is done in the personal Project education.
The buildtool is used to deploy completed LiveScripts
In the deployed code, associated Ddata is in a folder data below the top level
