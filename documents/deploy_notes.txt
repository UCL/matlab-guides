Notes on Deployment of examples

Live Scripts (*.mlx) can be exported as ipynb notebooks for Jupyter, but the 
user has to pip install some code, ensure matlab is on the path and still needs
a licence. This is too complicated for these simple examples.

Development of code, LiveScripts etc is done in the personal Project education.
The buildtool is used to deploy completed LiveScripts
In the deployed code, associated Data is in a folder data below the top level

Remove mlx output before transfer, create PDF and .m use .m in git?

MATLAB Drive:
Link to Guides MDrive folder:
https://drive.matlab.com/sharing/cd63980b-b7e2-4cfb-9a99-c3e060322513

Give out a link to the relevant folder e.g Guides, the link lets them see files.
To use and edit, use the  "+ Add to my Files" and select the "Copy Folder"
